    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        These potato chip cookies are the most delicious and texturally fascinating chocolate chip cookies you’ll ever bake. They don’t taste like potatoes, in case you were concerned about that. The potato chips add flavor that pairs perfectly with the dark chocolate, and add a gorgeous color to the cookie—but it’s the texture that makes them truly irresistible.
